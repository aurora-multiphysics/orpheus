Attempting to compute iterative loops of electromagnetic and thermal simulations for axisymmetic coil(s) in MOOSE.
Aiming to produce a tool for winding pack optimisation to replace existing COMSOL/APEX tool, building towards something that can verify against FEMM.

Starting by simulating magnetic field around 2D infinite wire, then expanding to 2D axisymmetric coil, then introducing non-linearity.
Should eventually build up different coupling levels and multiphysics solvers.
